        <p>This Privacy Policy explains what personal information we collect, use,
         share and otherwise process about individuals interacting with us on our website, applications, 
        services connected devices (e.g. connected TVs) and other offerings.  </p>
        <p>In this Privacy Policy, the Controller or Controllers of your Information means the 
        company that decides the purposes for which it is processed and how it is processed. Which company is the Controller in relation to the processing 
        of your Information will depend on which Offering you are using; it will often be the company responsible for providing that 
        Offering, as may be set out in our terms of use. In some circumstances, more than one Controller may be responsible for processing your Information, 
        for example, where Information is shared with other companies for a purpose set out in this Privacy Policy.

        or otherwise interacting with our Offerings, you consent to our use of
